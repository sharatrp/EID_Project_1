# EID_Project_1

This is the first project of the Embedded Interface design. This Project takes in data from a DHT sensor and displays it on a GUI made by the software QT 5

Here, the system consists on a Raspberry Pi3 and a DHT22 sensor is connected to it via GPIO Pin#4.

To run the code, copy all the files and folders onto your system and run the file named addendum.py using "python3 addendum.py"

The application that opens up, shows the values of the sensor upon pressing the Toggle button.
