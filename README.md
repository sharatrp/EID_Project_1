# EID_Project_1

This is the first project of the Embedded Interface design. This Project takes in data from a DHT sensor and displays it on a GUI made by the software QT 5

Here, the system consists on a Raspberry Pi3 and a DHT22 sensor is connected to it via GPIO Pin#4.

To run the code, copy all the files and folders onto your system and run the file named addendum.py using "python3 addendum.py"
